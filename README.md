*Interrogate the GitHub API to retrieve and display data regarding the logged in developer.*
# Github Access
I demonstrated access of the GitHub API in early commits by using JSON via the python "requests" library, as well as using the PyGitHub library.

# Github Visualisation
The [GitHubAPI.py](https://github.com/liamby12/Github-Access/blob/main/GitHubAPI.py) file retrieves information from the [GitHubâ€™s REST API v3](https://developer.github.com/v3/) and provides a graphical representation in a localhost adress.
This program returns a link to that localhost adress usually http://127.0.0.1:XXXXX/ . The graphical representation is of the repositories in the logged in users account. To log in you must replace the accessToken variable with a valid access token.
You can generate an access token at [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Without an access token the program will not be able to obtain the information it needs for visualisation.

## Plotly
The visualisation library I used is called Plotly. To learn more go to https://plotly.com/python/
This code generates a bubble chart similar to the image below [Link to Image](https://github.com/liamby12/Github-Access/blob/main/liamby%20visualisation.PNG). The bubble chart will vary depending on how many repositories the  logged in user has and how many interactions these repositories have had. I was somewhat limited by the number of repositories that are on my account. The more repositories and interactions that are present the better the chart will appear.

##  PyGithub
I used [PyGitHub](http://pygithub.readthedocs.io/) to develop the Python script [GitHubAPI.py](https://github.com/liamby12/Github-Access/blob/main/GitHubAPI.py).  PyGithub is a Python library to use the [Github API v3](http://developer.github.com/v3).

##Popularity
Popularity is a metric I generated to indicate how much interest there is in a repository. Popularity is generated by using the number of clones, unique clones, views, unique views and stargazers.

## Instructions
To run [GitHubAPI.py](https://github.com/liamby12/Github-Access/blob/main/GitHubAPI.py) please replace the value of the **accessToken = 'Your Access Token'** with your own personal access token and run the file. I recommend that you use a Virtual Environment as this is what I used when working on the project.
